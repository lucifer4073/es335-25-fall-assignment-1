# Task 3: Human Activity Recognition Model Comparison

## Question 1: UCI-HAR Model Performance on Personal Data

## Overview
This experiment evaluates the performance of a Decision Tree model trained on the UCI Human Activity Recognition (UCI-HAR) dataset when applied to personal activity data collected using smartphone sensors.

## Dataset Selection and Justification

### Chosen Dataset Version: **TSFEL Featurised Data**

**Rationale:**
- **Feature Compatibility**: TSFEL (Time Series Feature Extraction Library) provides standardized feature extraction that ensures consistency between training and testing data
- **Domain Alignment**: Both UCI-HAR and personal data use accelerometer measurements, making TSFEL features the most appropriate bridge between datasets
- **Preprocessing Consistency**: TSFEL applies the same mathematical transformations to both datasets, minimizing domain gap issues

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Personal Data Collection**: Linear accelerometer data (ax, ay, az in m/s²) collected at 100Hz
2. **Downsampling**: Data downsampled from 100Hz to 50Hz to match UCI-HAR sampling rate
3. **Segmentation**: 10-second windows (500 samples at 50Hz) to match UCI-HAR format
4. **Feature Extraction**: 468 TSFEL features extracted using identical configuration as training data
5. **Normalization**: Applied same StandardScaler used during UCI model training

### Detailed Classification Report

| Activity | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| WALKING | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 3 |
| WALKING_UPSTAIRS | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 3 |
| WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 3 |
| SITTING | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 3 |
| STANDING | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 | 3 |
| LAYING | 0.1667 | 1.0000 | 0.2857 | 3 |

## Key Observations

### 1. Model Behavior
- **Single Class Prediction**: The model classified ALL samples as "LAYING" (100% bias)
- **Perfect Recall for LAYING**: 100% of actual laying activities were correctly identified
- **Zero Recognition**: Complete failure to recognize walking, sitting, and standing activities

### 2. Domain Gap Issues
The poor performance (16.7% accuracy) indicates significant **domain transfer challenges**:

- **Sensor Differences**: Different smartphone models/orientations between UCI dataset and personal data
- **Sampling Rate Processing**: Despite proper downsampling from 100Hz to 50Hz, subtle frequency artifacts may remain
- **Individual Variation**: Personal movement patterns differ from UCI dataset subjects
- **Environmental Factors**: Different contexts, speeds, and movement styles
- **Data Quality**: Potential differences in sensor calibration and noise levels

### 3. Feature Distribution Mismatch
The model's tendency to predict only "LAYING" suggests:
- TSFEL features from personal data may have different statistical distributions
- The decision boundaries learned from UCI data don't generalize to personal patterns
- Possible overfitting to specific characteristics of UCI training subjects

## Technical Implementation

### Code Structure
```python
def solve_task3_question1_fixed_linear_accel():
    # Load personal linear accelerometer data (originally 100Hz)
    X_personal, y_personal, file_info = load_and_process_linear_accel_data()
    
    # Data is automatically downsampled to 50Hz for UCI compatibility
    # Extract TSFEL features (UCI-compatible)
    X_features = extract_tsfel_features_for_uci_compatibility(X_personal)
    
    # Load pre-trained UCI model and scaler
    uci_model = joblib.load('tsfel_model.pkl')
    uci_scaler = joblib.load('tsfel_scaler.pkl')
    
    # Scale and predict
    X_scaled = uci_scaler.transform(X_features)
    y_pred = uci_model.predict(X_scaled)
```

### Feature Engineering
- **Original Sampling**: Data collected at 100Hz for high fidelity capture
- **Downsampling**: Processed to 50Hz to match UCI-HAR dataset specifications
- **468 TSFEL Features**: Statistical, temporal, and spectral features extracted from accelerometer signals
- **Standardization**: Applied identical scaling parameters from UCI training
- **Dimension Matching**: Ensured feature vectors match expected input dimensions (468 features)

## Conclusion

### Performance Assessment: **CHALLENGING**
The 16.7% accuracy represents significant domain transfer difficulties, which is common in cross-dataset HAR evaluation.

### Key Learnings:
1. **Domain Adaptation Required**: Direct application of UCI-trained models to personal data requires additional domain adaptation techniques
2. **Individual Calibration Needed**: Personal activity recognition benefits from subject-specific training or fine-tuning
3. **TSFEL Compatibility**: Despite poor accuracy, TSFEL features provided the best compatibility between datasets

### Future Improvements:
- **Domain Adaptation**: Apply transfer learning techniques
- **Personal Fine-tuning**: Collect more personal training data
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better generalization
- **Feature Selection**: Identify most transferable features across domains

### Hyperparameter Optimization
```python
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 7, 10, None],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4],
